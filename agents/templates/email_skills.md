# Email Drafting Skills

## Goal
Get a reply. Not book a call, not close a deal — just start a real conversation. The Calendly link is there as a convenience, not the point.

## Tone

### Warm (default)
Founder to founder. You met at a conference, had a good chat, and are following up. Peer-level, not vendor-to-buyer. Use contractions, first names, and natural language. It should sound like a person typed it in 3 minutes, not a team workshopped it for a week.

### Professional
Same human voice, but frame it as a strategic partnership between organizations. Lead with how this fits their business priorities. More structured, executive-to-executive. Think "I've been following what your team is doing and see a clear overlap" — not "Dear Sir/Madam."

## Opening

If research found specific news about their org (sustainability commitment, ESG report, initiative), lead with that. Be specific — name the initiative, reference a date or metric. If research is thin, lead with shared context (how you found them, mutual background, their role). Never open with a generic compliment that could apply to anyone.

## Structure
- 5-8 sentences max, excluding case study bullets
- Paragraph 1: specific hook (research finding or shared context)
- Paragraph 2: who you are + why it's relevant to them (1-2 sentences)
- Case studies: 1-2 bullets, only if they genuinely match the recipient's industry/role/challenge. Skip entirely if nothing fits well. Preserve original hyperlinks exactly.
- CTA: end with Calendly link for booking a call

## Case Studies
Include 1-2 if relevant. Zero if nothing fits. Never force a case study just to fill space. The case study should make the recipient think "oh, they've done this for someone like me" — not "they're listing clients to impress me."

## Self-Promotion
Never mention Terra.do's funding, investor names, revenue, awards, or scale numbers. Keep it 100% about the recipient and relevant examples. The credibility comes from the case studies, not from bragging.

## CTA
End with the Calendly link. Keep it light — "Here's my calendar if you'd like to chat" not "I'd love to schedule a 30-minute deep-dive into your sustainability strategy."

## Low Research Fallback
If web research finds nothing specific, fall back to the person's context field and shared_background. Use whatever data exists. Don't fake specificity — a short honest email beats a long fabricated one.

## Dealbreakers — Restart If:
- Email states something the org didn't actually do (wrong facts are worse than no facts)
- Email reads like a template — could be sent to anyone with find-and-replace
- More than one ask or CTA
- Body is longer than 8 sentences (excluding case study bullets)

## Common Connections (revision pattern)
When a mutual connection is mentioned in a revision, weave it into the first paragraph naturally — but don't open the email with it and NEVER say or imply that the connection asked you to reach out, referred you, suggested you contact them, or anything similar. Just mention knowing them in passing, e.g. "I was chatting with [name] recently and your work at [org] came up" — not "Sarah suggested I reach out to you."

## Never Use
- "I hope this finds you well"
- "Synergy", "leverage", "align", "circle back"
- "I'd love to pick your brain"
- "Excited to connect" / "Thrilled to reach out"
- "As a leader in [industry]" (generic flattery)
- "I noticed that [obvious thing from their LinkedIn headline]"
- Any sentence that starts with "I" three times in a row

## Format
- Subject: plain text, under 60 characters, personal, no clickbait
- Body: valid HTML only — `<p>`, `<br>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<a href>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`. No markdown, no `<div>`, `<span>`, or inline styles. Wrap every paragraph in `<p>` tags.
- Sign off with the tag-specific HTML signature if available, otherwise just "Anshuman"
